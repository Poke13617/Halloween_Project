        <h2>Pump the Pumpkin</h2>
        <p>Pump the Pumpkin is part of the group called the vengeance-seeking vegetables. He enjoys rolling down hills, making new friends, and setting his local fire department on fire every now and then. To find this little guy, look somewhere that they would likely hide, you'll never know where it is until you see it</p>
        <h5>Be prepared, they may look slightly varied when compared to these as they may or may not change their movement sequence</h5>

        <h2>Greg the ghost</h2>
        <p>Greg the ghost loves his job of following people through the dark corners of their houses and under their beds. When the kinds say there is a monster in the closet, under the bed, or on the chair over yonder. That's him. But don't expect to find him very easy, as he can disappear. This will play a big part in finding him, as him and his twin brother gerG, will be hiding around the dark corners of this site system, be prepared to find both of them, as they are both going to be in different sites.</p>
